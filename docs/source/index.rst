Multiverse Quantum Network Simulator
====================================

**Multiverse** is a flexible and extensible simulator for evaluating **entanglement routing in quantum networks**.  
It is designed as an **architecture-agnostic, modular platform** that allows researchers and developers to:

- Prototype and evaluate entanglement distribution strategies
- Compare proactive, reactive, and hybrid routing paradigms
- Explore purification schemes, swapping strategies, and memory management
- Model heterogeneous quantum hardware and link architectures
- Investigate performance trade-offs under dynamic conditions

Unlike prior simulators, Multiverse avoids assuming a single protocol stack or rigid architecture.  
It provides conceptual building blocks—qubit lifecycle, memory management, time scheduling, and link architectures—so you can **define, test, and refine network functions** in an open-ended environment:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
